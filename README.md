# Welcome to PlanItRight


## Project Summary 


The application  'PlanItRight' specializes in providing 5-day itineraries to over 10 cities from the countries of South-east Asia. Apart from providing the daily schedule, it provides user more information about the attraction/ place, such as description, location attributes, opening hours and ratings. 

Some factors which make this application unique include- 
1. Trip Itineraries generated takes into account the  number of people going for the trip
2. Features such as ‘culture’, ‘outdoors’, ‘family’, and several more, add more customization to the trip.
3. Trip itineraries are ‘balanced’ in the sense that they include popular destinations as well as hidden gems, which are equally worth visiting.
4. Save trip itinerary for offline viewing.


## Motivation 


As NUS students, we are presented with ample opportunities to travel overseas through programs such as NOC, SEP and STEER. Many of us may have had the experience of  travelling abroad along with their family members as Singaporeans are known for being avid travellers,as part of their school trips or due to NS commitments but undertaking a journey on their own as independent adults can seem like a daunting experience. This is why making an application that provides a customised trip itinerary to users seemed like an idea worth investing time and effort in.

## Tools & Technologies used
Framework: NodeJS with ExpressJS <br/>
Frontend: HTML,CSS, Bootstrap <br/>
Web scraping: NightmareJS


## Issues 

1.  For our milestone 2 submission, the website generated trip itineraries through real-time web scraping. However, on 27th July (nearing our milestone 3 submission), the website from which we were obtaining data, was
    completely restructured and modified, and prevented crawlers. Hence, we were not able to scrape from that website anymore. Therefore, we had to search for a new option which could accomodate the capabilities of our
    application. This is why we have only 10 cities (at the point of submission).

2.  The information about the attractions in the itineraries displayed on the website is enabled through the Google Places API. However, the API key provided under a non-premium plan restricts usage in terms of the number of requests sent per day/second. This results in info being displayed for only some of the attractions.


## Upcoming Features
        
      Will be updated soon.
