Project Summary 
=================

The application  'PlanItRight' specializes in providing 5-day itineraries to over 10 cities from the countries of South-east Asia. Apart from providing the daily schedule, it provides user more information about the attraction/ place, such as description, location attributes, opening hours and ratings. 

Some factors which make this application unique include- 
Trip Itineraries generated take into number of people going for the trip
Features such as ‘culture’, ‘outdoors’, ‘family’, and several more, add more customization to the trip.
Trip itineraries are ‘balanced’ in the sense that they include popular destinations as well as hidden gems, which are equally worth visiting.
Save trip itinerary for offline viewing.


Motivation 
=================

As NUS students, we are presented with ample opportunities to travel 
overseas through programs such as NOC, SEP and STEER. Many of us
may have had the experience of  travelling abroad along with their 
family members as Singaporeans are known for being avid travellers,
as part of their school trips or due to NS commitments but undertaking a 
journey on their own as independent adults can seem like a daunting 
experience. This is why making an application that provides a 
customised trip itinerary to users seemed like an idea worth investing 
time and effort in.


User Stories 
==================

1. As a user, I want an authentication feature upon login in order to ensure my personal data remains confidential
2. As a tourist, I should be able to interact with the app by supplying trip information (trip destination, travel period, co-travellers etc) and displaying the resulting trip itinerary. 
3. As a tourist, I would like the trip itinerary to be displayed in a calendar view, with timings shown for visiting each of the places of interest so that I can plan my journey accordingly
4. As a tourist, I want the places of interest to be organised in my itinerary according to proximity from current location so as to reduce travel time and costs.
5. As a tourist, I need all my planned trip itineraries to be organised in one section of the app so that I do not have to spend time searching in different places and can instead view them in just one place 
6. As a tourist, I need an offline copy for each of my trip itineraries so that I can have access to them even when I go to places with poor internet connectivity
7. As a tourist, I want access to prices of different tour packages offered for each of the places of interest that I visit as per the generated itinerary so that I can mix and match according to my budget for the trip
8. As an administrator, I want the app to allow users to update their credentials so that the necessary information is up-to-date.
9. As an administrator, I want to moderate the reviews provided on the app in order to ensure a user-friendly environment
10.As an administrator, I need the app to store data in a secure database to ensure that the data user provides is protected. 
        


Issues 
============

1. Originally, as per milestone 2, the trip itineraries were generated by performing real-time scraping from the web. However, on 27th July (nearing our milestone 3 submission), the website from where we were scraping for data, was completely restructured and modified, and prevented crawlers. Hence, we were not able to scrap from that website anymore. Therefore, we had to search for a new option which could still keep up the original capabilities of our application. This is why we have only 10 cities (at the point of submission). 

2. The maps in our application are powered by Google. 


Transition to Milestone 3
===============	

        We were not able to implement a full working prototype, primarily due 
         to time restrictions we faced, since one of us was on a month long 
         vacation to the US and the other was doing an internship. 
         
        One of the major issues encountered was collaboration on the project as 
        we were working across different time zones and on many occasions 
        were unable to reach other. Another problem we were tasked with, which 
        is a challenge most have to grapple with as they embark on their 
        software development journey, was learning unfamiliar technologies, 
        whether it was picking up libraries on JS/ Python such as 
        Nightmare/Scrapy to assist us in web scraping or Gradle fixes for 
        verbose errors logged on Android Studio.

        Moving forward, we hope to implement the features of a simplified 
        version of the mobile application we have in mind on a Native Web App, 
        test those features and then integrate and migrate the data back to 
        Android Studio for further testing and debugging.
